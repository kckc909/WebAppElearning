# Use-Cases Folder

**Purpose**: Cross-domain orchestration

Use-cases replace repository orchestration logic.

Examples:
- student-dashboard.use-case.ts (aggregates courses, classes, notifications)
- course-enrollment.use-case.ts (workflow: enroll → payment → notify)

Phase 7B will populate this folder.
